# DaroodCOIN
A Crypto Currency that I made for fun with solidity

Once upon a time, I woke up realized that crypto currencies are the best way to trade social tokens for people and their common interest. Among my interest is making a token for my tribe for fun. This now became a project called #ProjectDRD or Project DaRooD (DRD) Coin. I programmed with this Solidity with Binance Smart Chain.

This token is made to be traded to be between Bosaso to Garissa, and is strictly for the Daroood tribe nothing but that.

It has a market cap of 150,000 DRD wand dividable by 18 digits. If you want to come and trade, make sure you have a Metamask wallet and go buy this token from PancakeSwap.

Steps on how to buy:
1. Purchase some BNB from Binance
2. Transfer BNB to Metamask wallet (before that make sure you ensure smart chain is intergrated to your wallet, learn by using this link: https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain)
3. Open https://pancakeswap.finance/
4. Connect your wallet by click the button
5. Click liquidity and then click add liquidity
6. Copy the contract below and purchase your desired amount with BNB ONLY!
7. Purchase and complete.
